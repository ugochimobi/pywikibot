Compat to Core Conversion
=========================

There is a guide to converting bot scripts from version 1 of the
Pywikibot framework called trunk or compat to the new version 3+,
so called rewrite or core. Refer `compat-to-core conversion Manual
<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/compat-to-core_conversion>`_
for further instructions.

There is also a helper script which does a lot of changes automatically.
Just call it::

    pwb.py update_script [<script to convert>]

and follow the instructions and hints.

Ask at `compat to core support request <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T247105>`_
for any Pywikibot compat to core migration support.
